# 📊 Vendor Performance Data Analytics

### 🧭 *An End-to-End Data Analytics Project using Python, SQL, and Power BI*

This project provides a complete data analytics pipeline to process, analyze, and visualize **vendor performance** data from large-scale datasets (2 GB+). It involves building **ETL pipelines**, performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and developing a **Power BI dashboard** for reporting and decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview
Organizations often collaborate with multiple vendors, making it challenging to track **performance**, **profitability**, and **cost efficiency**. This project automates the process of:
- Ingesting large CSV files into a structured database,
- Generating performance KPIs using SQL + Python,
- Analyzing trends and metrics through EDA, and
- Visualizing insights using Power BI.

This ensures **data-driven decision-making** and **faster reporting cycles**.

## 🧭 Problem Statement
Traditional vendor performance tracking is often **manual, time-consuming**, and not scalable for large datasets. The goal of this project is to:
- Automate vendor data ingestion from raw CSVs
- Build a robust summary layer for key KPIs
- Enable analysts to explore data quickly
- Deliver interactive dashboards to business stakeholders
